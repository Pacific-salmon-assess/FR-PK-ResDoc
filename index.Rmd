abstract: |
 Fraser River Pink salmon spawn throughout the Fraser Basin and the Stock Management Unit is comprised of a single Conservation Unit. Landslides have occurred causing migratory impediments to returning adults at different periods with the most notable being Hells Gate in 1914 and more recently the Big Bar Landslide discovered in 2019. Fraser Pink salmon survival is associated with sea-surface temperatures during early marine life, spring bloom timing, and the North Pacific Current, all of which are expected to change as the North Pacific warms as a result of climate change. Adult body size has declined over time, coincident with increasing abundances of salmon in the North Pacific, which has the potential to impact reproductive output as fecundity scales with female size. We fit a state-space spawner-recruitment model to available data to characterize stock dynamics and derive estimates of biological reference points to assess stock status. We then developed a simple closed-loop simulation model based on recent estimates of productivity to quantify future expected biological and fishery performance of the current, and an illustrative alternative, harvest control rule (HCR) along with a no fishing scenario. We estimated the proposed Upper Stock Reference point of 80% $S_{MSY}$ to be 4.6m (3.64m-6.11m; median and 80th percentiles), the Limit Reference Point $S_{gen}$ to be 1.72m (1.10m-2.70m), and the maximum removal reference rate ($U_{MSY}$) to be 0.56 (0.47-0.63). The most recent (2023) estimate of spawner abundance for Fraser Pink salmon is 9.58m suggesting the Stock Management Unit is in a “healthy” state. The existing HCR for Fraser Pinks has a very low probability (< 5%) of the stock falling below its Limit Reference Point, and a relatively high probability (87.5%) of spawner abundance being above the Upper Stock Reference Point over the next 10 years. Assuming fisheries fully utilize allowable catch, median annual catch is projected to 10.3m over the same time period. Assessment of an illustrative alternative HCR, which is more strictly compliant with DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, had similar biological performance and slightly worse fishery performance. The no fishing scenario did little to keep fish from falling below $S_{gen}$ (< 1%), and was slightly more likely to keep the stock above $S_{MSY}$ (~ 5%). A robustness test, where productivity was reduced to 10% of its estimate, yielded the same rankings between the current and alternate HCR, with predictibaly less catch and more biological risk. We conclude with recommendations on re-assessment triggers and potential areas to focus future work.
