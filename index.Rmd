abstract: |
 Fraser River Pink salmon spawn throughout the Fraser Basin and the Stock Management Unit is comprised of a single Conservation Unit. Landslides have occurred causing migratory impediments to returning adults at different periods with the most notable being Hells Gate in 1914 and more recently the Big Bar Landslide discovered in 2019. Fraser Pink salmon survival is associated with sea-surface temperatures during early marine life, spring bloom timing, and the North Pacific Current, all of which are expected to change as the North Pacific warms as a result of climate change. Adult body size has declined over time, coincident with increasing abundances of salmon in the North Pacific, which has the potential to impact reproductive output as fecundity scales with female size. We fit a state-space spawner-recruitment model to available data to characterize stock dynamics and derive estimates of biological reference points to assess stock status. We then developed a simple closed-loop simulation model to quantify future expected biological and fishery performance of the current, and an illustrative alternative, harvest control rule (HCR). We estimated the proposed U0pper Stock Reference point of 80% $S_{MSY}$ to be 4.7m (3.37m-8.39m), the Limit Reference Point $S_{GEN}$ to be 1.81m (0.87m-4.25m), and the maximum removal reference rate ($U_{MSY}$) to be 0.55 (0.41-0.67). The most recent (2023) estimate of spawner abundance for Fraser Pink salmon is 9.58m suggesting the Stock Management Unit is in a “healthy” state. The existing HCR for Fraser Pinks has a very low probability (< 0.02) of the stock falling below its Limit Reference Point, and a relatively high probability (>0.70) of spawner abundance being above the Upper Stock Reference Point over the next 10 years. Assuming fisheries fully utilize allowable harvest, median annual harvest is projected to 1.51m over the same time period. Assessment of an illustrative alternative HCR, which is more strictly compliant with DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, had slightly better fishery performance but at the cost of poorer biological performance. Two robustness tests of the current HCR suggest that if stock productivity were to decline sharply and/or be depressed for a prolonged period the current HCR may have an unacceptably high probability of the stock falling below its Limit Reference Point and hence being at risk of serious and irreversible biological harm. We conclude with recommendations on re-assessment triggers and potential areas to focus future work.
