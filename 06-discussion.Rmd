# Discussion  

## Summary of key findings  

We estimated several key biological benchmarks that were legislated to be evaluated (*help*) in the Fish Stocks Provisions of Canada's revised Fisheries Act. 
$S_{gen}$, recruitment that yields 80% $S_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}$ estimated in our spawner-recruit analysis are all suitable candidates for the limit, upper stock, and removal reference points. 
These were estimated at `r benchmarks[1,1]` (`r benchmarks[1,2]` - `r benchmarks[1,3]`), `r benchmarks[2,1]` (`r benchmarks[2,2]` - `r benchmarks[2,3]`) and `r benchmarks[3,1]` (`r benchmarks[3,2]` - `r benchmarks[3,3]`; median and 95th percentiles) respectively (Table \@ref(tab:bench-table)).  

The current HCR showed the least conservation risk at the expense of less harvest. 
An alternative HCR based on a lower OCP at $S_{gen}$ and a TAM cap at $U_{MSY}$ was risky for conservation and provided some short term gain in harvest. 
The third HCR tested was naively based in the precautionary approach where there is a linear increase in TAM from 0% at $S_{gen}$ to $U_{MSY}$ (`r benchmarks[3,1]*100`%) at the recruits that would yield $S_{MSY}$}. 
This naive PA compliant HCR was indeterminate between the others tested; the spawning escapement typically fell in what would be the amber zone, and interestingly, catch appeared to converge with the riskier HCR near the end of the simulation, but escapements remained relatively higher. 
This third HCR is impractical from a management perspective since the escapement goal is "humped" near the upper OCP meaning when the run gets below recruits that would produce 80% $S_{MSY}$ managers need to figure out how to escape more fish (*check*). The performance shown from this HCR was promising and it is an area for further exploration.  

*recognize these are relative and not absolute P - all sorts of issues cause not hitting HCR*

All forward simulations assumed that forecast error and outcome uncertainty were lognormally and normally distributed. 
Management of other species like Fraser Sockeye may make the shape of true outcome uncertainty (i.e. the error in hitting target escapement) be right skewed, which could also be affected by the 4 year life cycle of Fraser Sockeye. 
*add forecast error worse at low sizes*

*robustness, sensitivity (note PSC is worst data and we're using all now - we argued for it)*
