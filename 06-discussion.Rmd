# DISCUSSION  

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS  

In this working paper we briefly review our current understanding of Fraser River Pink salmon stock structure and distribution, assessment history, and ecosystem and climate factors affecting the stock. 
We then fit a state-space spawner-recruitment model to available to data to characterize stock dynamics, and derive estimates of biological benchmarks to assess stock status. 
Lastly, we developed a simple closed-loop simulation model to quantify future expected biological and fishery performance of the current and an illustrative alternative harvest control rule.  

Fraser Pinks spawn throughout the Fraser Basin and comprise a single Conservation Unit though there is evidence of life history differences between populations that spawn in the upper and lower Fraser River (above and below Hell’s Gate). 
Landslides have occurred throughout the Fraser causing migratory impediments that have impacted returning adult salmon at different periods with the most notable being Hell’s Gate in 1913 and more recently the Big Bar Landslide in 2019. 
Fraser Pink salmon survival is associated with sea-surface temperatures during early marine life, spring bloom timing and the North Pacific Current, all of which index physical and biological oceanographic conditions that likely affect prey production, transport, and availability during early marine life. 
Adult body size has declined over time, coincident with increasing abundances of salmon in the North Pacific, which has the potential to impact reproductive output as fecundity scales with female size.  

We found that the Fraser Pink stock is moderately productive with intrinsic productivity ($\alpha$) estimated to be 3.94 (2.56-5.84 recruits per spawner) and equilibrium stock size $S_{EQ}$ equal to `r benchmarks[4,1]`m (`r benchmarks[4,2]`m-`r benchmarks[4,3]`m). 
We estimated the upper Wild Salmon Policy biological benchmark of 80% $S_{MSY}$ to be `r benchmarks[1,1]`m (`r benchmarks[1,2]`m - `r benchmarks[1,3]`m), and the biological benchmark $S_{gen}$ to be `r benchmarks[2,1]`m (`r benchmarks[2,2]`m-`r benchmarks[2,3]`m). 
The most recent (2023) estimate of spawner abundance for Fraser Pink salmon is 9.58m which is well above the upper bound on the estimate of the upper Wild Salmon biological benchmark suggesting the stock is in a “healthy” state. 
This is consistent with a formal Wild Salmon Policy status assessment that has assessed the stock as in the “green” Wild Salmon Policy status zone with high confidence.  

We found that the existing HCR for Fraser Pinks has a very low probability (< 0.02) of the stock falling below the lower biological benchmark, and a relatively high probability (>0.70) of spawner abundance being above the upper biological benchmark, over the next 10 years. 
Assuming fisheries fully utilize allowable harvest, which may not be the case if the Pink fishery is constrained, for example, to limit impacts on non-target species, average annual harvest is projected to 1.51m over the same time period. 
Assessment of an illustrative alternative HCR which is more strictly compliant with DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework had slightly better fishery performance but at the cost of poorer biological performance.     

The two robustness tests of the current HCR suggest that if stock productivity were to decline sharply and/or be depressed for a prolonged period the current HCR may have an unacceptably high probability of the stock falling below the lower biological benchmark and hence being at risk of serious and irreversible biological harm.  


## CAVEATS AND ASSUMPTIONS  



## EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ASSESSMENT TRIGGERS FOR THE STOCK  

Exceptional circumstances and assessment triggers are intended to proactively identify conditions and/or circumstances that may represent a substantial departure from those under which the advice in this assessment was developed. We recommend a re-assessment be triggered if any of the following occur:  

- Stock productivity declines sharply and stays depressed for more than 3 generations (e.g., 3 more generations of negative recruitment residuals such that there are 7 consecutive generations of them).  

- New information becomes available that results in changes to the historical time-series of spawner abundance and harvests. 

- New information becomes available that results in changes to our understanding of stock-structure (e.g., the current Conservation Unit is split into two) and/or major drivers of stock dynamics. 

- *Fisheries Management considers changes to the existing HCR and/or revises the fishery objectives against which it needs to be evaluated. - delete based on Convo w/ Adam?*


## AREAS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK  

- Development of lifecycle models that partition freshwater and marine survival and explicitly account for changing body mass in spawner-recruitment model and simulations. Explore environmental drivers of survival at life stages.   

- Evaluate evidence time varying spawner-recruitment dynamics (e.g., capacity due to recolonization post Hells Gate), and consequences for reference points and HCR performance.   

- Detailed understanding of changes in spatial distribution of adult spawners (i.e., above and below Hells Gate) and implication for stock status and future production (e.g., the effect of declining body size and migrating past hydraulic barriers).  

- Further exploration of realistic metrics (or sets of metrics with various assumptions) to use for outcome uncertainty and forecast error in forward simulations.  

- Review history of Fraser Sockeye and Pink co-management and consider how past and future dynamics will affect management into the future.
