Parameter,Prior,Bounds,Description
$ln(\alpha)$,"$\sim N(1,2)$","$[0,\inf]$",Natural log of intrinsic rate of growth
$S_{MAX}$,$0.75*max(S)$,,Spawners that maximize recruitment (hyperprior)
$\sigma_{S_{MAX}}$,$0.75*max(S)$,,Sd of above (hyperprior)
$\beta$,"$\sim N(1/S_{MAX}, sigma_{S_{MAX}})$",,"Magnitude of within brood-year density-dependence, where the priors based on $S_{MAX}$ have both been bias corrected  (via Quan et al., 2018)"
$\phi$,"$\sim U(-1,1)$","$[-1,1]$",Lag-one correlation in interannual variation in survival
$\sigma_R$,"$\sim N(1,2)$","$[0,\inf]$",White noise process standard deviation in survival.
$ln(R_0)$,"$\sim N(0,20)$","$[0,\inf]$",Natural log of unobserved recruitment in the first seven years of process model.
$\sigma_{R_0}$,"$\sim Inv-Gamma(2,1)$","$[0,\inf]$",Standard deviation in unobserved recruitment in the first year of process model.
