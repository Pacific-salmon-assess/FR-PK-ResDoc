## Model fit and diagnostics  

The spawner-recruit model successfully converged with a maximum R-hat of *1.003 - how do I override scipen in R?*`r round(max(model.summary$Rhat, na.rm = T), 3)`, traceplots that suggested MCMC chains were well mixed, and a minimum ESS of `r round(min(model.summary$n_eff, na.rm = TRUE), 0)`, and chains that appeared well mixed (See Supplement *B - make ref* for fully reproducible analysis and full diagnostics). 

The relationship showed some evidence of compensation at low spawner abundances (below ~5M), overcompensation at high spawner abundances (over ~10M) and somewhat of a poor fit between 4-10 million (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-SRR)).  


## Stock status and trends  

Ricker $\alpha$ was estimated at `r alpha.CI[2]`(`r alpha.CI[1]`-`ralpha.CI[3]`), $\beta$ at `r beta.CI[2]`(`r beta.CI[1]`-`r beta.CI[3]`), and bias corrected $\sigma$ at  `sigma.CI[2]`(`r sigma.CI[1]`-`r sigma.CI[3]`; medians and 95th percentiles Table \@ref(tab:tab-prior-posterior)). 
AR1 recruitment residuals did not show a strong trend across the time series, but may be in a weak decline since around 2011 return year (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-rec-resid)).  

Estimates from the state-space spawner-recruit model estimated benchmarks (median and 95% CIs) of 80% $S_{MSY}$ at `r benchmarks[1,1]` (`r benchmarks[1,2]`-`r benchmarks[1,3]`), $S_{Gen}$ at `r benchmarks[2,1]` (`r benchmarks[2,2]`-`r benchmarks[2,3]`) and $U_{MSY}$ at `r benchmarks[3,1]` (`r benchmarks[3,2]`-`r benchmarks[3,3]`; Table \@ref(tab:tab-bench)). 
With the current stock at `r filter(data, year==2023)$spawn`, it appears we are well above and over the 95th percentile of 80% $S_{MSY}$. 
Total recruits are currently at `r filter(data, year==2023)$spawn + filter(data, year==2023)$harvest`, which is just slightly higher than 80% $R_{S{MSY}}$. *caveat about IF you applied the current HCR in here though?*. 

Kobe plots are a common tool to visualize conservation and fisheries trade-offs through time (*cite*). In Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe) we see the an overfished stock still experiencing overfishing (i.e. harvest above $U_{MSY}$, with spawners below $S_{MSY}$) beginning in 1959 and continuing during the early part of the time series (note this was before current management was adopted in 1987). 
Over fishing was in part due to the troll fishery learning to catch Pinks in outside waters; and this over fishing was recognized in 1957 when the IPSFC was put in charge to manage Fraser Pink fisheries shared by the US and Canada [@rickerHistoryPresentState1989]. 
Since then, catch has reduced and the stock has rebounded to higher levels (Figure \@ref(fig: fig-catch-esc-HCR)), with some years being intermediate where the stock was over fished at high abundances (top right quadrant, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe)),and under fished at low abundances bottom left quadrant, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe)). 
Overall, the Kobe plot suggests the stock is currently being under fished, but attaining the harvest in the HCR can be difficult due to other management considerations (*cite section*).  

DFO's State of the Salmon Program has developed a rapid status evaluation algorithm to have a quantitative, repeatable method to assess status across stocks [@pestalStateSalmonRapid2023]. 
After providing the program with our estimates of biological benchmarks, and justifications for using our time series of data, we were provided updated results that suggest this stock is in the ***add when we get*** (*pers comm - Sue?*). See appendix (*ref*) for a detailed output from the rapid status algorithm.  


## Harvest control rule performance  

When looking at the baseline productivity for the full data set, a general conclusion is the current HCR poses less conservation risk than the alternative TAM HCR, but catch is lower and more variable (Table \@ref(tab:tab-HCR-performance)). 
The naive PA approach (*is this what we're calling this?*) is intermediate between the 2 and has comparable catch stability to the alternative TAM HCR (difference 7% less stable), and as an artifact of stability is approximately 4% more likely to have a "good catch year" when looking at the catch index metric. 
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC) shows this conservation and fishery trade off where the current HCR maintains a large escapement with less catch, the alternate TAM HCR is more risky but provides more catch (at least in the short term), and the naive PA approach is intermediate. 
The current HCR stabilizes relatively fast, while the others are slower with wider CIs; which may not be suprising since it's based on a fixed escapement policy. 
In the two alternative HCRs, catch starts to converge near the end of the five generation simulation, displaying some short term reward in the alternative TAM HCR at the expense of greater conservation risk.  
When interpreting performance, it's crucial to look at both Table \@ref(tab:tab-HCR-performance) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC)and to remember the table summarizes performance across the five generations forward, while the trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC)) illustrate finer, year scale performance.  

Performance in the robustness is relatively the same, where HCRs are similarly ranked as in the baseline conditions.  
The only change in rank is the PA HCR is 38 percent more stable than the alternative TAM HCR.  

The sensitivity check which compared 1993 onward to the full data set showed the same rankings with conservation metrics, but catch was relatively higher and more stable in the PA HCR. 
Catch stability was the lowest of all simulations, which isn't surprising when remembering there are only 11 data points between 1993 and present data.    
(*not sure what to add without opening a can of worms to argue for time varying models, looks more conservation risky, a lot less catch*).
