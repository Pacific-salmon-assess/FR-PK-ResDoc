# RESULTS  

## MODEL FIT AND DIAGNOSTICS  
Visual inspection of trace plots indicated all chains were well mixed for leading parameters, all parameters had R-hat < 1.01 (maximum of 1.003), and all had effective sample sizes > 1,500 suggesting reasonable model convergence.

## BIOLOGICAL BENCHMARKS, STOCK STATUS AND TRENDS  

Posterior means, medians and 80% credible intervals for leading spawner-recruitment parameters and biological benchmarks are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-bench-parms). 
We found that the Fraser Pink stock is moderately productive with intrinsic productivity ($\alpha$) estimated to be `r alpha.CI[2]` (`r alpha.CI[1]`-`r alpha.CI[3]` recruits per spawner; median and 80% credible interval) and equilibrium stock size $S_{eq}$, which is a function of intrinsic productivity ($\alpha$) and the strength of within stock density dependence ($\beta$), estimated to be `r benchmarks[4,1]`m (`r benchmarks[4,2]`m-`r benchmarks[4,3]`m). 
Recruitment anomalies were estimated to be weakly positively correlated through time ( $\phi$ = `r phi.CI[2]` (`r phi.CI[1]`-`r phi.CI[3]`)) with no strong time trend, though the most recent 4 brood years were all negative. (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-rec-resid)). 

As a result of relatively weak density dependence, expected yield (i.e., “surplus” production above replacement) and recruitment was relatively flat across a wide range of spawner abundances (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-SRR)).
Nonetheless, the spawner abundance expected to maximize long-term sustainable yield ($S_{MSY}$) was estimated to be `r benchmarks[2,1]*1.25`m and so the Upper Stock Reference Point of 80% $S_{MSY}$ was `r benchmarks[2,1]`m (`r benchmarks[2,2]`m-`r benchmarks[2,3]`m). The harvest rate expected to lead to maximum sustainable yield (Eqn. \@ref(eq:get-Umsy)), or maximum Removal Reference, was estimated to be `r benchmarks[3,1]` (`r benchmarks[3,2]`-`r benchmarks[3,3]`), and lastly, the Limit Reference Point $S_{gen}$ was estimated to be `r benchmarks[1,1]`m (`r benchmarks[1,2]`m-`r benchmarks[1,3]`m).  

The history of the status of the Fraser Pink stock can be visualized as a “Kobe plot”, a common way to visualize stock status over time relative to biomass (or abundance) and exploitation based reference points. 
The Kobe plot for Fraser Pinks (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe)) highlights that the stock was overfished and experiencing overfishing (i.e. harvest above $U_{MSY}$, with spawners below $S_{MSY}$) at the beginning of the time series in 1959 and that this generally continued until the current management regime was adopted in 1987. 
Overfishing may have been due, at least in part, to the troll fishery learning to catch Pinks in outside waters; and this overfishing was recognized in 1957 when the IPSFC was put in charge to manage Fraser Pink fisheries shared by the US and Canada [@rickerHistoryPresentState1989]. 
Since then, catch has been reduced and the stock has rebounded to higher levels of spawner abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch-esc)), with some years being intermediate where the stock was over fished at high abundances (top right quadrant, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe)), and under fished at low abundances bottom left quadrant, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-kobe)). 
Overall, the Kobe plot suggests the stock is currently being under fished, but attaining the harvest goal defined in the HCR can be difficult due to other management considerations.  

The most recent (2023) estimate of spawner abundance for Fraser Pink salmon is `r filter(data, year==2023)$spawn`m which is well above the upper bound on the Upper Stock Reference Point of 80% $S_{MSY}$ suggesting the stock is in a “healthy” state. 
This is consistent with the formal Wild Salmon Policy status assessment that takes data quality and multiple metrics into account [@pestalStateSalmonRapid2023], and which has assessed the stock as in the green Wild Salmon Policy status zone with high confidence (see *LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS AND WILD SALMON POLICY RAPID STATUS SUMMARY: FRASER PINK STOCK MANAGEMENT UNIT - to add citation once published*).  

## HARVEST CONTROL RULE PERFORMANCE  

The existing HCR for Fraser Pinks has a very low probability of the stock falling below the Limit Reference Point ($S_{gen}$), and a relatively high probability of spawner abundance being above the Upper Stock Reference Point (80% $S_{MSY}$), over the next 10 years (Table \@ref(tab:tab-HCR-performance); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC)). 
Assuming fisheries fully utilize allowable harvest, which may not be the case if the Pink fishery is constrained to limit impacts on non-target species, the median annual harvest is projected to 1.28m over the same time period. 
Approximately `r perf.metrics[1,7]`% of years are expected to result in harvests greater than the "good catch" index (`r catch.index`m fish; a semi-arbitrary indicator of a ‘good year’ based on the average of the top 3 catches since the year 2000). 

In contrast, the alternative, illustrative Precautionary Approach compliant HCR had a slightly higher probability of the stock falling below the Limit Reference Point (`r perf.metrics[2,3]`% vs `r perf.metrics[1,3]`%) and a lower probability of spawner abundance being above the Upper Stock Reference Point (`r perf.metrics[2,4]`% vs `r perf.metrics[1,4]`%) (Table \@ref(tab:tab-HCR-performance); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC)). 
These increased biological risks came with the benefit of higher average annual harvest and greater catch stability from year to year, but also a slightly smaller number of years where harvests were expected to be greater than the average of the top 3 years of catch since 2000.

Performance of the HCRs under the two robustness tests predictably resulted in poorer biological and fishery performance because they were both associated with lower assumed intrinsic productivity (low $\alpha$ median: `r low.alpha` recruits per spawner, recent data $\alpha$ median: `r recent.alpha` recruits per spawner). 
For example, the probability of the stock falling below the Limit Reference Point was `r perf.metrics[3,3]`% and `r perf.metrics[5,3]`% for the low productivity and truncated dataset robustness tests, respectively. 
However, the relative biological and fishery performance of both the current and alternative illustrative HCR remained the same as in the base case closed loop simulations (Table \@ref(tab:tab-HCR-performance); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fwd-SC)).
