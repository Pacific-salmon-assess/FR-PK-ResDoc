## Observed data  

Recruitment has been variable across the timeseries with an average of `r mean(rec_prop$rec)` (SD `r sd(rec_prop$rec)`). Early in the timeseries, recruitment increased from  some of the lowest recorded abundances to `r filter(rec_prop, year==1991)$rec` million in 1991, then decreased to `r filter(rec_prop, year==1999)$rec` million in 1999, and rebounded to the highest abundance on record of `r filter(rec_prop, year==2003)$rec` million in 2003. 
Since this peak in 2003, recruitment has been declining. 
Across the timeseries, harvest ranged from `r min(rec_prop$harvest)` million in `r filter(rec_prop, harvest==min(rec_prop$harvest))$year` to `r max(rec_prop$harvest)` million in `r filter(rec_prop, harvest==max(rec_prop$harvest))$year`. Escapement ranged from `r min(rec_prop$spawn)` million in `r filter(rec_prop, spawn==min(rec_prop$spawn))$year` to `r max(rec_prop$spawn)` million in `r filter(rec_prop, spawn==max(rec_prop$spawn))$year` (Figure \@ref(fig:catch-esc)).  

A marked decrease in the exploitation rate occurred during the low return in 1999. Since then the mean exploitation rate has remained low at `r round(mean(filter(rec_prop, year>1999)$ER), 2)`% (SD = `r round(sd(filter(rec_prop, year>1999)$ER), 2)`), compared to a mean exploitation rate of `r round(mean(filter(rec_prop, year<1999)$ER), 2)`% (SD = `r round(sd(filter(rec_prop, year<1999)$ER), 2)`) before 1999.  

## Modelling  

- ricker parms, residual structure, phi, etc...

Estimates from the state-space spawner-recruit model estimated benchmarks (median and 95% CIs) of 80% $S_{MSY}$ at `r benchmarks[1,1]` (`r benchmarks[1,2]` - `r benchmarks[1,3]`), $S_{Gen}$ at `r benchmarks[2,1]` (`r benchmarks[2,2]` - `r benchmarks[2,3]`) and $U_{MSY}$ at `r benchmarks[3,1]` (`r benchmarks[3,2]` - `r benchmarks[3,3]`; Table \@ref(tab:bench-table)).
